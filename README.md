#Movie Recommendation System Project
##Project Overview
This project aims to build a movie recommendation system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and cosine similarity. The recommendation system suggests movies based on the similarity of their tags, which are derived from various features of the movies such as genres, cast, crew, keywords, and an overview. The project involves preprocessing movie data, transforming it into meaningful features, and calculating similarities to provide recommendations.
